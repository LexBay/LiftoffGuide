# LiftoffGuide
IA Guide for the Updated Liftoff Curriculum

# Welcome to Liftoff! 

This guide is meant for IAs to have a better understanding of what to expect for each class during our time in Liftoff.

We will have different folders for each of the tracks that use our Liftoff curriculum to make sure that folk have access to all of the necessary information. 

Please feel free to make pull requests on this repo if you want something to be changed or think it could be improved and a member of LC staff will review your request!
